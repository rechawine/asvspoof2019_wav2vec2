General
-------
This project is for ASVspoof.
It includes a few models for early experiments on ASVspoof 2019 LA.


Folder structure
----------------
| - DATA: folder to store data

Usuage
------
This is mainly for NII internal experiments on ASVspoof2019.
If you want to try it on other data, please use ../04-asvspoof2021-toy.
That project is easier to follow

# Download ASVspoof 2019 data data
  To use this code, please:
  1. Download ASVspoof2019 LA from
     https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3336
  2. Convert flac into waveforms
  3. Create symbol links to the waveform files as DATA/asvspoof2019_LA/README suggests

# Download pre-trained models
bash 01_download.sh

# Choose one project
cd lfcc-lcnn-sigmoid

# Run 00_demo.sh
bash 00_demo.sh > log_batch 2>&1 &

Everything will be running in the background.


Notes
-----
1. On model.py
   The model.py of each project is created from a common template.
   It has many functions unnecessary for ASVspoof model but required for the Pytorch scripts.

   These are the unnecessary functions but must be defined:
   1. model.prepare_mean_std: to load mean / std of input / target features. 
      For ASVspoof models, mean = 0, std = 1, no normalization is conducted.
   2. model.normalize_input: see message above for model.prepare_mean_std
   3. model.normalize_target:  see message above for model.prepare_mean_std
   4. model.denormalize_output: ASVspoof model doesn't use this

2. On input and output data in model.py
   
   Waveform is the input data of the script. After waveform is loaded, 
   the front-end computes the acoustic features in each mini-batch.
   No normalization is conducted.
   
   ASVspoof models do not load target labels from disk. It gets the target label from file
   names and protocol (i.e., target_vec in model.py). Thus, model.normalize_target is not used
   on the target label. 
     
   model.forward() gives [scores, target_vec, True] to the script, and the script will 
   give [scores, target_vec, True] to Loss().compute() as the 1st non-self argument.
   Thus, in Loss().compute(outputs, target),
   outputs[0] denotes scores, and outputs[1] denotes target_vec.

   Note that target in Loss() is an empty list []. This argument "target" is for target data
   loaded from disk. But for ASVspoof models, the target labels are not loaded from disk, 
   thus target is []. This behavior is controled by output_dirs = [] in config.py. It tells
   The script not load anything as "target".
   


For a high-level explanation on how the functions and objects work in the script, please
