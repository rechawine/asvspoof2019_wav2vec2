1. 01-nsf
   projects for neural source-filter waveform models

2. 02-asvspoof
   projects for ASVspoof (2019 LA)
   This is the preliminary experiment on ASVspoof 2019 LA. 
   This is intended for NII internal experiments.
   For ASVspoof CMs, please check 03-asvspoof-mega or 04-asvspoof-toy

3. 03-asvspoof-mega
   projects for ASVspoof (2019 LA) with more systems, 
   This is for the Interspeech2021 paper.

4. 04-asvspoof-toy
   Example ASVspoof project with a toy data set.
   If you don't know how to preare the training data, please check this project.

   Note that model in this project is different from ASVspoof2021 LA/DF/PA baseline
   For ASVspoof2021 baseline, please check https://www.asvspoof.org/    

5. 05-nn-vocoders
   A few neural vocoders: waveglow, wavenet, and blow (for voice conversion)
   This project is mainly for tutorial purposes
   

6. 06-asvspoof-ood
   Projects for ASVspoof with abstention

7. 07-asvspoof-ssl
